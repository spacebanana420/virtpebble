# Virtpebble platform support

Virtpebble is cross-platform, although its OS and CPU support is limited to QEMU's support itself.

### Supported operating systems

* Linux-based
* Windows
* MacOS
* FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and other similar systems

### Supported host CPU architectures

* x86
* ARM
* MIPS
* PPC
* RISC-V
* s390x
* SPARC

While you can run QEMU on an unsupported CPU architecture, this requires that QEMU uses an interpreter for translating CPU instructions, which results in worse performance.
