# virtpebble
Virtpebble is a terminal virtual machine manager and runner. Virtpebble will be a TUI-based virtual machine manager, creator and launcher. It uses [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) to run your virtual machines, with support for acceleration, such as KVM.

Exceptionally, Bhyve support for FreeBSD as an alternative to QEMU is in my plans.

This project is still in early development and isn't functional yet.
